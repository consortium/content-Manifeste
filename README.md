# content-Manifeste

IDML (and other) source files for Winterthur Manifeste.

Also, transpect configuration files (unless they are stored at https://github.com/consortium/BinB/tree/master/transpect/adaptions/ where they can be shared with other, similar projects).

May also contain other artifacts, typically conversion output.

This is stored separately from [BinB](https://github.com/consortium/BinB) because the content must be kept private.
